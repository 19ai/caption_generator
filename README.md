# caption_generator: An image captioning project
[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/anuragmishracse/caption_generator/blob/master/LICENSE)

A project to generate a caption for any image in natural language i.e. English. The architecture for the model is inspired from [1] by Vinyals et al. The module is built using [keras](https://keras.io/), the deep learning library. 

This repository serves two purposes:
- To present my model and results
- To provide a modular architecture to the community
