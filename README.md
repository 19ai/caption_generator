A project to generate a caption for any image in natural language i.e. English. The architecture for the model is inspired from [1] by Vinyals et al. The module is built using [keras](https://keras.io/), the deep learning library. 
This repository serves two purposes:
- To present my model and results
- To provide a modular architecture to the community
